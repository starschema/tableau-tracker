# Tableau-Tracker

Tableau Tracker extension enables you to easily measure and understand how people consume and interact with dashboards. Tableau Tracker can anonymously collect data like clicks and filter changes for every single user so you can create better visualizations and optimize performance.



## How Tableau Tracker Works

#### Anonymous data collection

Tableau Usage Tracker was built for the post-GDPR era, created with privacy by design in mind. It does not collect personally identifiable information from users like ID, name or email address.

#### Track every click in Tableau

Track and analyze filter changes, filter states, window size, workbook id, session time and more right within Tableau.

#### Pre-built Insights Dashboard

Understand behavior patterns instantly using the built-in dashboard created by Starschema's team of Data Visualization Heros.

#### Your Usage Data in your Tableau

Use our Web Data Connector to access your data `/wdc `endpoint and download the example workbook `/example/Tableau_Tracker_Demo.twbx` to see a sample tracking dataset in action.

This will produce 4 jar/war file in the `build/libs` folder:

- `tableau-tracker-{version}.jar`: The original jar without dependencies.
- `tableau-tracker-{version}-all.jar`: Executable jar file with embedded Tomcat.
- `tableau-tracker-{version}.war`: Deployable war file (can be deployed to Tomcat).
- `tableau-tracker-{version}-installer.jar`: The installer of the application.

## Configuration

All configuration can be set either by adding the [`environment variables`] below, or by writing them in the [resources/application.conf](resources/application.conf) file directly. 

- **Server port** [`TT_PORT`]: The port where this application should run on. (Only needed if running standalone.)

- **Database url** [`TT_DB_URL`]: The URL of the Postgres DB.

- **Database type** [`TT_DB_DRIVER`]: The type of the database. Now supported: Postgres, SQLServer. (In the environment variable the whole jdbc driver name is necessary, so either 'org.postgresql.Driver' or 'com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver')

- **Keystore password** [`TT_SSL_KSP`]: The password used to generate the certificate.

- **Private key Password** [`TT_SSL_PKP`]: Password for the SSL private key.

## Running

Execute this command in the repository's root directory to run:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Installation / deployment

The application can also be installed with the `tableau-tracker-{version}-installer.jar`or can be deployed to a Tomcat server using the `tableau-tracker-{version}.war` file produced at build.
